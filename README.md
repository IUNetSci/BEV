# BEV (Bot Electioneering Volume)

If you are interested in building your own BEV, please check out [BotSlayer](https://osome.iuni.iu.edu/tools/botslayer/) which is BEV plus many new features.
BotSlayer is an application that helps track and detect potential manipulation of information spreading on Twitter.
We have made BotSlayer available through docker and AWS AMI so everyone can easily install and run their own instances.
